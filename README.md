# IT-Platformer

Introduction:

This simple platformer game will be my innovative solution and will be inspired by the classic Super Mario.

Step 1:

The first step in making this project is finding inspiration and the right software to use. I've decided to make a platformer game similar to Super Mario, with a few simple levels that the player would have to run and jump through. The software I've chosen to use is Godot. This software provides you with templates and projects that you an build off of, which is really helpful because this means that I can use the basic functions such as movement and gravity from a template and focus on other mechanics and designs in the game.

Step 2:

The second step is to find a template and learn the basics of how to use Godot. I found that there is many tutorials online and they are mostly pretty helpful. Finding a template is very simple because there is so many on Godot, it is just a matter of finding the one that feels the best to play on, because the looks will be changed.

Step 3:

The next step in creating this game is to remove some of the looks and functions of the template and add my own.

Step 4:

The final step, once all the designs and chsnges to the game have been finished is to simply submit the game.
